    <h2 align="center">Description</h2>
    <p align="center">Creamy white sauce pasta with veggies is one of my favorite pasta recipes. It’s cheesy and oh so good! Packed with veggies, this is a great way to make kids eat their veggies! I like to serve it with a side of garlic bread for that perfect comforting meal.</p>

                    <li><b>Pasta:</b> I like using penne pasta probably because that’s how I always had it in India but you can definitely use other pasta shapes. Macaroni and Rigatoni will also work well. I personally don’t like using spaghetti.</li>
                    <li><b>Veggies:</b>You can use any veggies that you like in this pasta, the day I made this pasta, I had peppers and broccoli at home and that’s what I used in the recipe along with onion and sweet corn. I also use tons of garlic because garlic just goes so well in this pasta.</li>
                    <li><b>Milk:</b> I like using whole milk but 2% would also work. Adding cream makes it richer.</li>
                    <li><b>Seasonings:</b> I have added dried Italian seasoning and dried oregano, you can use herbs like basil and thyme as well. Add more or less of the seasoning and adjust to taste.</li>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil 150 grams of pasta according to instructions on the package. I used regular penne pasta which was supposed to be boiled for 9 to 11 minutes. and drain. Make sure you don’t overcook your pasta, you want it al-dente. Note: use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is boiled, drain it using a colander and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add all the veggies –
             <ul>
                <li> small red onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium red pepper, sliced</li>
                <li>4 cup small broccoli florets</li>
                <li>2 cup sweet corn (frozen corn which I added to hot water for 5 minutes before using).</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Cook the veggies for 2 minutes. They should remain crunchy. You can use other veggies like carrots, peas as well.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove veggies onto a plate.</li>
        <li>To another pan or you can use the same pan, now add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of butter.</li>
        <li> Once the butter melts, add the 5-6 chopped garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Then add in 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of flour.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour continuously, using a wire whisk for around 30 to 60 seconds. You don’t have to brown the flour much.</li>
        <li>Then add in 2 cups of milk. You can also add 1/4 cup heavy cream here or use additional 1/4 cup milk.</li>
        <li>Mix everything using a whisk so that there are no lumps formed.</li>
        <li>Add in the seasonings:
             <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasonings</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes (to taste)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul></li>      
        <li>Mix in everything and let the sauce simmer.</li>
        <li>Sauce will thicken as it simmers and in 4 to 5 minutes it will coat the back of the spoon. Turn heat to lowest.</li>
        <li>Add in the veggies and the boiled pasta.</li>
        <li>Toss until the pasta and veggies are coated with the sauce. Taste test and adjust the seasonings at this point. Serve warm!</li>
