    <h2 align="centre">Description</h2>
    <p>This is the easiest, fluffiest pancake recipe I’ve made. These are, without a doubt, my family’s favorite homemade pancakes!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups (195g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon aluminum-free baking powder, important to level the tablespoon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of fine sea or table salt, reduce to 1/4 teaspoon if sensitive to salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups (295ml) milk, dairy or non-dairy</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons (70g) unsalted butter, plus more for skillet</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, reduce if sensitive to vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the butter: Melt the butter and set it aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Combine wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Don’t worry if the butter solidifies a little.</li>
        <li>Mix the batter: Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour the milk mixture into the well and gently whisk until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are perfectly normal. As the batter rests, you should see it begin to bubble. It will be thick, like cake batter. If it seems too thick, add a splash more milk to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Preheat the skillet: Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. To check if it’s ready, sprinkle a few drops of water on the surface. They should “dance” around and evaporate quickly.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancakes: Brush the skillet with melted butter for crispy edges (you can skip this if using a good nonstick pan). Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or a large cookie scoop, then gently spread each pancake into a 4-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes: After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until they’re lightly browned and cooked through. Enjoy your pancakes right away with warm syrup, more butter, and berries.</li>
    </ol>
